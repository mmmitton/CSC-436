Description

This app calculates the nutritional information for customized starbucks orders. It ideally starts with the base recipe for each drink (initialized to grande size) then allows the user to customize the recipe by changing the milk type, adding syrups, toppings, sauces, and powders, then re-calculates the nutritional information based on those changes.

(currently it only has data loaded in for cafe latte, lavender oatmilk latte, and chocolate cookie frapaccino, but has data for all possible changes.)
